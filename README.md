# Echos

Echos is a 3D maping software designed to take in drone video feed and render a 3D map of the space the drone flew through.
After generating the 3D map we throw it into a rendering software and load it on to a virtual reality headset.

The end goal of Echos was to create a software that first responders can use in a variety of situations. The most obvious situtation being disaster relief by being able to map out areas that may be dangerous for the first responder to get to.

Other applications of this can be maping out a crime scene so the officers can walk through it as may times as they want without distrupting the scene.
