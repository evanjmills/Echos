# Echos

Echos is a 3D maping software designed to take in drone video feed and render a 3D map of the space the drone flew through.
After generating the 3D map we throw it into a rendering software and load it on to a virtual reality headset.

The end goal of Echos was to create a software that first responders can use in a variety of situations. The most obvious situtation being disaster relief by being able to map out areas that may be dangerous for the first responder to get to.

Other applications of this can be maping out a crime scene so the officers can walk through it as may times as they want without distrupting the scene.

# Purpose:

We want to create a full VR environment of an actual asset that exist in our real world. Mostly objects, humans, and areas. 

The system can be used from analyzing destroyed environments to spectating a full 3D modeled human anatomy.

This is the first implementation in what will soon become something much greater. We hope that in the future doctors, architects, and even firefighters. 

# Tools we used:

- Unreal Engine 4 : Used to modulate the 3D object in VR
- Metashape : For 3D modeling
- Python 3 : We did not necessarily fully implemented but Metashape has a python module that can be used to fully automate the image rendering process.
- Oculus Go
- Flyable Drone : Requires camera and autonomous implementation support
